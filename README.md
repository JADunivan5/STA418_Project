# STA418_Project
My statistical project in R will be used to show tenedencies and trends among NFL teams using the play by play data from every game.


## The Problem  
The goal or problem here is to find out what statistic's lead to higher win percentages in the NFL. Then as well charting the tendencies and trends of how teams aligned, and overall usage of certain formations.

* the down the yardage 
* the time on the clock 
* descripition of the play
* play type
