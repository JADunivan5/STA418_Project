# STA418_Project
My statistical project in R will be used to show tenedencies and trends among NFL teams using the play by play data from every game.


## The Problem or Questions
* What situations changed Expected Win Percentage most?
* What formations were used the most in certain situations?
* What were the overall tenedency of teams?
* Were there any tenedencies to the teams that won the most games?


## The dataset 
The dataset contains everyplay from every game from this past nfl season. It provides:
* the down the yardage 
* the time on the clock 
* description of the play
* play type
* Quarter
* Team that is on offense and Team that is on Defense
* And many other variables that are available located in the dataset within this repository.  

## Goals
- My goals are to be able to display my knowledge of R through the use of tidyverse and other packages. As well as create graphs and tables that accurate represent and depecit the data, with the hope of answering the questions stated above.
 
## Why am I interested in this topic?
For me NFL Sunday is something that has been a part of my life for many years. Now after studying statistics the last 4 years I want to learn more about the "why" behind teams decisions and plays. I want to know how successful certain teams were in certain situations. I also want to look for situations where teams continually make one decision that negatively affects their outcome in the game. I am also hoping that by doing a project in the sports statistics field I can use it for future employers on my resume to showcase my skills and ability working with sports statistics.
