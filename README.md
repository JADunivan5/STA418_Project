# STA418_Project
My statistical project in R will be used to show tenedencies and trends among NFL teams using the play by play data from every game.


## The Problem  
The goal or problem here is to find out what statistic's lead to higher win percentages in the NFL. Then as well charting the tendencies and trends of how teams aligned, and overall usage of certain formations.

## The dataset 
The dataset contains everyplay from every game from this past nfl season. It provides:
* the down the yardage 
* the time on the clock 
* description of the play
* play type
* Quarter
* Team that is on offense and Team that is on Defense
* And many other variables that are available located in the dataset within this repository.  
 
# Why am I interested in this topic?
For me NFL Sunday is something that has been a part of my life for many years. Now after studying statistics the last 4 years I want to learn more about the "why" behind teams decisions and plays. I want to know how successful certain teams were in certain situations. I also want to look for situations where teams continually make one decision that negatively affects their outcome in the game. I am also hoping that by doing a project in the sports statistics field I can use it for future employers on my resume to showcase my skills and ability working with sports statistics.
